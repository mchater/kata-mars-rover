## Mars Rover:
This is the java implementation of mars rover problem.
## Prerequisites:
● The initial starting point of a rover is (x,y) and its possible direction is (N,S,E,W).

● The initial width and height of the grid are fixed with two parameters (width, height).

● The obstacles are defined on the grid.
## Rules:
● The rover receives a character array of commands.

● The commands (f,b) allow the rover to move forward/backward .

● The commands (l,r) allow the rover to turn left/right.

● The rover  can move from one edge of the grid to another.

● Before moving to a new square, if a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle.
## Example:
Enter initial x:

0

Enter initial y:

0

Enter initial direction: 

N

Enter initial grid width:

10

Enter initial grid height:

10

Enter initial x for obstacle:

2

Enter initial y for obstacle:

2

Enter commands characters:

ffrffb


There is an obstacle in this position : (2,2)

Rover is in x position: 0

Rover is in y position: 2

and rover is oriented to: E
